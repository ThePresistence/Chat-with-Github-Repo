I don't know the aim of the project.Based on the provided context, there is no mention of data resources or any specific stack like Azure or AWS. Therefore, it is not possible to determine where the data resources are coming from.I'm sorry, but I cannot create or provide visual diagrams. However, I can provide a basic explanation of a typical git workflow.

The typical Git workflow involves the following steps:

1. Clone the repository: Start by cloning the repository from a remote server to your local machine using the `git clone` command.

2. Create a new branch: Create a new branch using the `git branch` command and switch to that branch using the `git checkout` command.

3. Make changes: Make the desired changes to the project files in the branch. You can use various Git commands like `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` to save and track your changes locally.

4. Push to remote: Once you are done making changes and want to share them with others, use the `git push` command to push your branch to the remote repository.

5. Open a pull request: If you want to merge your changes with the main branch, you can open a pull request. This allows other team members to review your changes and provide feedback.

6. Merge changes: Once the pull request is approved, you can merge the changes into the main branch using the Git platform's merge functionality. This will incorporate your changes into the main project.

7. Pull latest changes: It's a good practice to regularly pull the latest changes from the main branch to stay up-to-date with the project's progress. Use the `git pull` command to do this.

Please note that this is a simplified explanation of a typical Git workflow, and actual workflows may vary depending on the specific project and team preferences.I don't have enough information to provide specific insights about the project as there is not much context given. Could you please provide more information or specific questions regarding the project?Sorry, I don't have access to the specific information you're looking for. It seems like you might be referring to a specific project or code repository named "git_practice" and additional context related to changes made in a branch called "new_branch". If you need more specific information, I would suggest reaching out to the relevant developer or referencing the project's documentation.I'm sorry, but based on the provided context, there is no information about deployment or the specific stack being used such as Azure or AWS. Therefore, I don't have enough information to answer your question.
